# Somnify: Rapid Sleep Induction System 🌙💤

**Inducing deep sleep in 10-15 minutes through science-backed, closed-loop neuromodulation. 🧪🧠**

---

## 🚀 Overview
**Somnify** is an advanced R&D project developing a multimodal wearable ecosystem designed to accelerate sleep onset. By combining neuroscience, precision engineering, and real-time biometric feedback, Somnify aims to safely guide users from wakefulness to Delta-wave sleep in under 15 minutes—significantly faster than the natural 25-30 minute average. 📉💤

## 🧠 The Science
Somnify utilizes a **closed-loop system** that adjusts stimulation in real-time based on EEG and HRV markers. The project is built upon a comprehensive research strategy covering 49 critical topic areas. 🧬📊

### Core Modalities:
*   **Binaural Acoustics:** Targeted 0.5-4 Hz Delta range entrainment to sync brainwaves. 🎧
*   **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS):** Non-invasive electrical neuromodulation for immediate parasympathetic activation. ⚡
*   **Haptic/Vibrotactile:** Rhythmic soothing patterns mimicking a heartbeat or rocking sensation. 💓
*   **Paced Breathing Light:** Red/Amber wavelength fading protocols to boost natural melatonin. 🔴

## 🛠️ System Architecture
*   **Hardware:** Ultra-slim headband or pillow-integrated sensors with dry-electrode EEG & PPG. 🔌
*   **Processing:** Edge-priority computing for minimal latency and enhanced data privacy. 🛡️
*   **Software:** AI-powered "NeuroSleep Coach" app for personalized routines, CBT-I modules, and progress tracking. 📱

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1: Proof of Concept** – Mechanism validation and initial prototype (Topics 1-16). 🛠️
2.  **Phase 2: Clinical Pilot** – Small-sample human testing with EEG/HRV marker validation (Topics 31-36). 🏥
3.  **Phase 3: Hardware Refinement** – Ergonomics, miniaturization, and sensor optimization. 📏
4.  **Phase 4: Launch** – Regulatory compliance (FDA/CE), manufacturing, and market distribution. 🚀
